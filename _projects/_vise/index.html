<p>i bought an old woodworker's vise from a local antique tool dealer--<a href="http://www.dowdstools.com/">dowd's tools</a>. the tool is functional, but there is a couple of decades worth of patina that needed to be scraped off.</p>

<p>i disassembled the vise and cleaned the individual parts with a wire wheel brush set from northern tool and equipment ($4.00 well spent).</p>
<p>after the parts were cleaned, i primed the vise with rustoleum rust reformer. next, i painted the vise with green paint.</p>
<p></p>finally, i secured the vise to the workbench and cut out new jaw liners. i had to cut the carriage mounting bolts with a dremel (good times).</p>
