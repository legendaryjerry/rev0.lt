<p>this was my first electronics project. i completed this project in january 2014 when i lived in a house that had an automatic garage door opener. i used a raspberry pi to open a garage door from a web browser using webiopi. there are several documented projects online that do this using a relay wired directly to the garage door opener, but i did not own the house that i was staying in so i wanted to make something that was 1. less permanent and 2. less likely to set things on fire.</p>
<p>i removed the momentary switch from a spare garage door remote and replaced it with an ambient light sensor. i then ran an led from the raspberry pi and used it to set off the ambient light sensor, which would 'press' the switch and open the garage door.</p>
<p>this worked well, but i noticed that there was some empty space in the garage door remote so i decided to cram my homemade optoisolator circuit into the remote.</p>
<p>finally, i soldered the resistor directly to the led and wound a loop to prevent the led from moving in the case.</p>
