<br><p>i picked up a lot of 4 rusty, old saws from ebay for $20.00. two of the saws are 'keepers', but they needed a lot of tlc. for this project, but i decided to ABUSE SCIENCE&reg; instead of using elbow grease. i read several write-ups on <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/electrolysis-rust-remover/">using electrolysis</a> to remove rust so i decided to try it out myself...</p>
<p>there was years of patina on the saw blade. i recently restored a woodworker's vise, which took tools, wire brushes, and a lot of elbow grease.</p>
<p>i removed the saw handle and i noticed that the area beneath the handle was in worse shape than the rest of the blade.</p>
<p>next, i filled a plastic tub with enough water to submerge the saw blade and a sacrificial piece of steel and i added a few tablespoons of baking soda.</p>
<p>finally, i connected the negative lead of a battery charger to the submerged saw blade, and the positive leave to the sacrificial piece of steel using a short length of steel core wire.</p>
<p>i was concerned about playing at science with electricity and water, so i periodically checked the temperature of the battery and the wall outlet. also, every reference that i read on this process indicated that flammable gas is released during the process so you should take necessary precautions, including working in a well-ventilated area.</p>
<p>after a few minutes, the reaction started to take place. i noticed the rust pooling near the sacrificial piece of steel. after about 30 minutes, the reaction was more noticeable.</p>
<p>i left the saw blade overnight and i woke up to a mess.</p>
<p>i removed the saw blade and cleaned it off with a 3m sanding block. </p>
